# **Description sentences**
P1: System Setup / Portfolio project introduces the student developer to and immerses them 
in learning the industry-standard skills needed to develop a dynamic website.  These skills include
downloading and installing environment software, such as local server and command-line editor; 
configuring a local server; setting up Git on the client; creating an account on GitHub
and enabling communication between the client and GitHub; creating an account on DigitalOcean
and enabling communication between GitHub and Digital Ocean and enabling remote login from client 
to Digital Ocean; tracking software and configuration changes on the client via Git and GitHub; 
creating and cloning repositories; setting up a web domain; and implementing a web page that 
is tracked using Git/GitHub and is deployed to Digital Ocean and viewable on the student's domain.

# **Demo information** 
Students are not being asked to do demos for this project.

# **Details for Teaching Team**
No login is required.
On the web page, if you hover over the links, it will show you what the link is resolving to. 

# **Outside Code**
No outside code was used in this project.  I did use an image of vintage wallpaper/background for
the background of my web page.  I don't remember where I got it from, but I used it for a web 
project in CSCI E12, and I remember I went through the exercise of ensuring I didn't need to note 
the source of it then.
